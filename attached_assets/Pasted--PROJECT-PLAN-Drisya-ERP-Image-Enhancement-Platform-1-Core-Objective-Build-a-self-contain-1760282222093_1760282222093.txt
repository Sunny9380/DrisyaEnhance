🧭 PROJECT PLAN — “Drisya ERP Image Enhancement Platform”
1. 🎯 Core Objective

Build a self-contained, AI-powered image enhancement system (React + Node + Python/OpenCV backend) that can:

Remove or adjust white backgrounds

Apply high-quality enhancement

Place products onto selected templates (100+)

Process bulk uploads (1000+ images)

Provide coin-based access control for users

2. 🧱 High-Level Architecture
🔸 Frontend (React)

Purpose: User interface for uploading, selecting templates, managing coins, and downloading results.

Modules:

Auth & Profile

Register/Login, wallet (coins), history.

Template Gallery

100+ templates shown as thumbnails (searchable & filterable).

Upload Center

Upload ZIP or multiple images.

Progress display during upload and processing.

Processing Dashboard

Shows batch status (e.g., “Processing 243/1000…”).

Download Section

Download processed ZIP or individual images.

Admin Panel

Manage templates, users, and coin pricing.

🔸 Backend (Node.js + Express)

Purpose: API gateway between frontend, image processor, and database.

Main Responsibilities:

Receive uploaded ZIP

Unzip and queue all images

Assign selected template

Pass jobs to the Image Processing Engine

Track status & completion

Manage coin-based transactions

Serve processed outputs

🔸 Image Processing Engine (Python or Node Worker)

Purpose: Handles the heavy lifting — background removal, enhancement, and placement.

Key Features:

Background detection & masking (OpenCV, U²-Net model)

Color correction & lighting normalization

High-clarity sharpening + contrast boost

Smart alignment (auto-center product on template)

Apply selected template layer (PNG/JPG background)

Batch automation with queuing (Redis or RabbitMQ)

🔸 Database (MongoDB or PostgreSQL)

Tables/Collections:

users: login info, coin balance

templates: background assets, tags

jobs: batch upload details

images: each image’s status, output path

transactions: coin purchase + usage

admin: template and user management

🔸 Storage

Local / S3 bucket for:

Raw uploads

Processed outputs

Templates (100+)

ZIP downloads

3. ⚙️ Detailed Functional Modules
3.1 Module 1 — Ready to Use

Purpose: Quick placement & download.
Flow:

Select template

Upload ZIP

System:

Unzips images

Removes background

Enhances image

Places on selected template

Compresses outputs into ZIP

Download ready ZIP

3.2 Module 2 — Make a Drisya Look

Purpose: Advanced customization.
Options:

Aspect ratio (1:1, 4:5, 16:9)

Size (px)

Platform preset (Instagram, Amazon, etc.)

Light/shadow control per background
Flow:

User sets configurations

System applies these settings globally to the batch

Outputs generated accordingly

3.3 Module 3 — Surprise for You

Purpose: Auto-create creative versions (themed).
Flow:

User selects “Surprise” theme

System applies automatic background, color, and shadow variations

Outputs ready as image/video set

3.4 Module 4 — Payment (Coin Based)

Flow:

User buys coins (1 coin = X ₹)

Each processed image deducts defined coins

Admin sets:

Coin rate per image/module

Promotions, bonuses

4. 🧠 Image Processing Pipeline (Core Engine Logic)
Step 1: Background Detection & Removal

Use OpenCV for color thresholding

For better accuracy: local U²-Net or MODNet model for matting

Step 2: Retouch & Enhancement

Auto white balance correction

Sharpen edges, reduce noise

Color normalization

Resize & crop for composition

Step 3: Apply Template

Overlay transparent product on the selected template

Adjust lighting to match template tone

Auto-center + add drop shadow if needed

Step 4: Export & Compress

Save as high-quality PNG/JPG

Combine into a ZIP for batch download

5. ⚡ Performance & Scaling Plan
Feature	Strategy
Bulk uploads	Queue system (Redis / RabbitMQ)
Parallel processing	Multi-threaded workers (Python/Node cluster)
Progress tracking	Job table + WebSocket updates
Storage	AWS S3 / GCP Storage for scalability
Caching	Use Redis for frequently used templates
Compression	Stream ZIP generation on-the-fly
6. 🔐 Security & Stability

JWT-based authentication

File upload validation (only JPG/PNG, size limits)

Coin system to prevent abuse

Role-based access (Client / Admin)

Encrypted API keys and payment gateway integration

7. 🧩 Tech Stack Summary
Layer	Tech
Frontend	React + Tailwind + Redux Toolkit
Backend API	Node.js + Express
Image Engine	Python (OpenCV, Pillow, U²-Net) or Node (opencv4nodejs, sharp)
Database	MongoDB / PostgreSQL
Storage	Local / AWS S3
Queue	Redis / BullMQ
Auth	JWT
Payment	Razorpay / Stripe
Deployment	Docker + Nginx + CI/CD
8. 🚀 Development Roadmap
Phase 1 – MVP (4–6 Weeks)

User auth & coin system

Template management (Admin)

Upload single/batch images

Background removal + blue placement

Download ZIP

Phase 2 – Advanced (6–10 Weeks)

Customization module (aspect ratio, platform presets)

AI-based background matching

Batch progress tracking (live)

Payment gateway + transaction logs

Phase 3 – Scaling & Automation

100+ templates with tagging

Creative (Surprise) outputs

Video versioning

Auto email notifications & analytics dashboard

9. 🧩 Example User Flow (for Your Case)

You (admin) upload 100+ templates.

You log in → select Template #23 (Blue Background).

You upload a ZIP (say, 1000 product images).

System unzips and queues all 1000 files.

Image engine processes each:

Removes white background

Enhances clarity

Places on blue background template

Once all are done → generates output.zip

You download output.zip with all cleaned, ready-to-use images.
