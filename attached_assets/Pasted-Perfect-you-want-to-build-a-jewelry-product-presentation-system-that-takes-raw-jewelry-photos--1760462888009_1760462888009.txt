Perfect — you want to build a **jewelry product presentation system** that takes raw jewelry photos (like your first image) and automatically transforms them into **high-quality promotional visuals** (like your second image) using elegant background templates, lighting styles, and enhancement pipelines.

Here’s your **complete project planning document (without code)** — structured like a professional Product Planning & Strategy document 👇

## 💎 Project Title

**AI-Driven Jewellery Image Enhancement & Presentation System**

---

## 🎯 Objective

To develop an intelligent platform that automatically converts raw jewelry product images into studio-quality, marketing-ready visuals using predefined premium background templates, lighting effects, and enhancement models.

---

## 🧩 Project Overview

The system enables jewelry sellers to:

* Upload raw product photos (single or bulk, e.g., 1000 images in a ZIP).
* Select from 100+ pre-designed **background and lighting templates** (e.g., matte velvet, marble, moody shadows, spotlight).
* Automatically generate **cleaned, enhanced, and styled** images ready for e-commerce or promotional use.
* Maintain consistent brand aesthetic and high visual quality.

## ⚙️ Core Functional Modules

### **1. User Module**

* User registration & authentication
* Subscription or credit-based usage (optional for business model)
* Upload interface (single/bulk)
* Template selection interface (gallery view)
* Project management dashboard (view processing status, download results)

---

### **2. Template Management Module**

* 100+ predefined **background templates** with:

  * Texture style (velvet, marble, suede, glass, etc.)
  * Lighting style (moody, daylight, window shadow, gradient)
  * Color palette (gold-friendly tones, dark luxury, etc.)
* Each template includes:

  * Background image
  * Lighting overlay pattern
  * Shadow map / mask reference
* Admin panel to upload new templates dynamically

---

### **3. Image Processing & Enhancement Module**

This is the AI/automation engine of the project.

#### **Pipeline Stages:**

1. **Input Cleanup**

   * Background removal (AI mask detection for jewelry edges)
   * Reflection & glare correction
   * Color balancing (neutral tone matching for gold/silver/diamond)
   * Noise reduction & sharpening

2. **Placement & Styling**

   * Auto-centering of jewelry in chosen template
   * Adjust shadow direction and scale based on lighting type
   * Blend jewelry edges naturally with background lighting

3. **Enhancement**

   * Add realistic depth and reflections
   * Apply moody light gradient or contrast curve
   * Auto-generate shadow based on item contours
   * Adjust highlights for diamonds/gems for sparkle realism

4. **Output**

   * High-resolution PNG/JPEG (transparent or fixed background)
   * Auto-resized versions for web, Instagram, and print

---

### **4. Template Preview Generator**

* Before full processing, user can preview jewelry on a few sample templates
* Dynamic rendering (AI or smart composite preview)
* “Try Before Apply” mode

---

### **5. Storage & Delivery**

* Cloud storage (AWS S3, GCP, or similar)
* Output packaged in ZIP for bulk download
* Option for API callback or direct upload to e-commerce platform

---

### **6. Admin / Management Module**

* Manage templates
* Track user projects and processing usage
* Control pricing, credits, and analytics
* Monitor AI performance (image quality feedback)

Would you like me to now create **two professional PDFs** from this (like:
1️⃣ *Project Requirement Document (PRD)*
2️⃣ *Software Design Document (SDD)*
both based on this plan)?

These would be formatted for stakeholders/investors — ready for presentation.
