## 🐛 Bugs Found & Fixed (4/4)

### 🔴 CRITICAL BUGS (1/1) - ✅ FIXED

#### Bug #1: Bulk Reprocess ZIP Creation Crash
**Severity:** 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**File:** `server/routes.ts` line 1434

**Issue:**
```javascript
// ❌ Before (undefined variable)
const output = fsSync.createWriteStream(zipPath);

// ✅ After (using imported function)
const output = createWriteStream(zipPath);
```

**Impact:** Bulk reprocess feature would crash when creating ZIP file  
**Root Cause:** `fsSync` was not imported, should use `createWriteStream` from `fs`  
**Fix Applied:** Changed to use the already-imported `createWriteStream` function  
**Verification:** ✅ Architect reviewed and approved  
**Production Ready:** ✅ Yes

---

### ⚠️ MINOR BUGS (3/3) - ✅ FIXED

#### Bug #2: Accessibility Warning - Missing Dialog Description
**Severity:** ⚠️ MINOR  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**File:** `client/src/pages/Gallery.tsx`

**Issue:** Browser console warning:
```
Warning: Missing `Description` or `aria-describedby={undefined}` for {DialogContent}
```

**Impact:** Accessibility compliance issue for screen readers  
**Fix Applied:**
- Added `DialogDescription` import
- Added description to preview modal: "Compare original and processed versions of your image"
- Added description to bulk reprocess dialog: "Choose a new template to apply to selected images"

**Verification:** ✅ Browser console clean, no warnings  
**Production Ready:** ✅ Yes

---

#### Bug #3: Memory Leak in File Previews
**Severity:** ⚠️ MINOR  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**File:** `client/src/pages/Upload.tsx`

**Issue:**
```javascript
// ❌ Before (memory leak)
<img src={URL.createObjectURL(file)} alt={file.name} />
```

**Impact:** Memory leak when uploading 50+ files (object URLs never revoked)  
**Fix Applied:**
```javascript
// ✅ After (proper cleanup)
const [filePreviewUrls, setFilePreviewUrls] = useState<string[]>([]);

useEffect(() => {
  const urls = files.map(file => URL.createObjectURL(file));
  setFilePreviewUrls(urls);
  
  return () => {
    urls.forEach(url => URL.revokeObjectURL(url));
  };
}, [files]);

<img src={filePreviewUrls[index]} alt={file.name} />
```

**Verification:** ✅ URLs properly created and cleaned up  
**Production Ready:** ✅ Yes

---

#### Bug #4: Template Preview Re-render Issue
**Severity:** ⚠️ MINOR  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**File:** `client/src/components/TemplatePreview.tsx`, `client/src/pages/Upload.tsx`

**Issue:** Unnecessary re-renders causing canvas flicker  
**Fix Applied:**
- Memoized `templateStyle` object in Upload.tsx to prevent recreation on each render
- Added cleanup function to cancel Image event handlers on unmount
- Prevents race conditions when rapidly switching templates

**Verification:** ✅ Architect reviewed and approved  
**Production Ready:** ✅ Yes
